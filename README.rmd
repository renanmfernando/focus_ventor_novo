An interface to structure the information provided by the [Brazilian Central Bank](https://www.bcb.gov.br).
This package interfaces the [Brazilian Central Bank web services](https://dadosabertos.bcb.gov.br) to provide data already formatted into R's data structures.

## Install

From CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("rbcb")
```

From github using remotes:

``` r
remotes::install_github('wilsonfreitas/rbcb')
```

### Usage

Load the package:

```{r}
library(rbcb)
```

#### The `get_series` function

<a name="single-series"></a>
Download the series by calling `rbcb::get_series` and pass the time series code is as the first argument.
For example, let's download the USDBRL time series which code is `1`.

```{r}
rbcb::get_series(c(USDBRL = 1))
```

Note that this series starts at 1984 and has approximately 8000 rows.
Also note that you can name the downloaded series by passing a named `vector` in the `code` argument.
To download recent values you should use the argument `last = N`, see below.

<a name="tibble-objects"></a>
```{r}
rbcb::get_series(c(USDBRL = 1), last = 10)
```

<a name="download-types"></a>
The series can be downloaded in many different types: `tibble`, `xts`, `ts` or `data.frame`, but the default is `tibble`.
See the next example where the Brazilian Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA) is downloaded as `xts` object.

<a name="xts-objects"></a>
```{r}
rbcb::get_series(c(IPCA = 433), last = 12, as = "xts")
```

or as a `ts` object.

<a name="ts-objects"></a>
```{r}
rbcb::get_series(c(IPCA = 433), last = 12, as = "ts")
```

<a name="multiple-series"></a>
Multiple series can be downloaded at once by passing a named vector with the series codes.
The return is a named list with the downloaded series.

```{r}
rbcb::get_series(c(IPCA = 433, IGPM = 189), last = 12, as = "ts")
```


#### Market expectations

<a name="market-expectations"></a>
The function `get_market_expectations` returns market expectations discussed in the Focus Report that summarizes the statistics calculated from expectations collected from market practitioners.

The first argument `type` accepts the following values:

- `annual`: annual expectations
- `quarterly`: quarterly expectations
- `monthly`: monthly expectations
- `top5s-monthly`: monthly expectations for top 5 indicators
- `top5s-annual`: annual expectations for top 5 indicators
- `inflation-12-months`: inflation expectations for the next 12 months
- `institutions`: market expectations informed by financial institutions

The example below shows how to download IPCA's monthly expectations.

```{r}
rbcb::get_market_expectations("monthly", "IPCA", end_date = "2018-01-31", `$top` = 5)
```


#### OLINDA API for currency rates

<a name="olinda-currency-rates"></a>
Use currency functions to download currency rates from the BCB OLINDA API.

```{r}
olinda_list_currencies()
```

Use `olinda_get_currency` function to download data from specific currency by
the currency symbol.

```{r}
olinda_get_currency("USD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-03")
```

The rates come quoted in BRL, so 3.10 is worth 1 USD in BRL.

**Parity values**

Type A currencies have parity values quoted in USD (1 CURRENCY in USD).

```{r}
olinda_get_currency("CAD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-01")
```

```{r}
olinda_get_currency("CAD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-01", parity = TRUE)
```

Type B currencies have parity values as 1 USD in CURRENCY, see AUD, for
example.

```{r}
olinda_get_currency("AUD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-01")
```

```{r}
olinda_get_currency("AUD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-01", parity = TRUE)
```

#### Currency rates

<a name="currency-rates"></a>
Use currency functions to download currency rates from the BCB web site.

```{r}
rbcb::get_currency("USD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-10")
```

The rates come quoted in BRL, so 3.0970 is worth 1 USD in BRL.

All currency time series have an attribute called `symbol` that stores its own
currency name.

```{r}
attr(rbcb::get_currency("USD", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-10"), "symbol")
```

Trying another currency.

```{r}
get_currency("JPY", "2017-03-01", "2017-03-10") |> Ask()
```

To see the avaliable currencies call `list_currencies`.

```{r}
rbcb::list_currencies()
```

There are 216 currencies available.

#### Cross currency rates

<a name="cross-currency-rates"></a>
The API provides a matrix with the relations between exchange rates, this is the
matrix of cross currency rates.
This is a square matrix with the all exchange rates between all currencies.

```{r}
x <- rbcb::get_currency_cross_rates("2017-03-10")
dim(x)
```

```{r}
# Since there are many currencies it is interesting to subset the matrix.
cr <- c("USD", "BRL", "EUR", "CAD")
x[cr, cr]
```

The rates are quoted by its columns labels, so the numbers in the BRL column are worth one currency unit in BRL.
